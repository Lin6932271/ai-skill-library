name: radare2
description: "Use this skill whenever the user wants to analyze binaries with radare2/r2 from the command line, including reverse engineering, disassembly, function analysis, strings/import inspection, patching, binary diffing, hex inspection, or r2 scripting. Also use it when the user mentions PE/ELF/Mach-O/DEX/WASM files together with CLI analysis, `rabin2`, `rasm2`, `radiff2`, `r2pipe`, or asks for radare2 command help on Windows/Linux/macOS."

# radare2

A binary-analysis skill for the `radare2` CLI. The focus is completing recon, analysis, locating, exporting, and lightweight modification directly from the command line, without relying on a GUI.

## ACTION REQUIRED (execute immediately after reading)

2. `NOW`: confirm whether the current task falls within this skill's applicable scope
3. `NEXT`: read `../tool-index.md`, verify tool availability and actual paths
4. `NEXT`: when a tool is missing, invoke bootstrap; do not guess paths
5. `ACT`: enter step 1 of the "Workflow" and execute; do not stop at a confirmation state

## Applicable scope

Prefer this skill when the user has any of these intents:

- Wants to analyze `exe`, `dll`, `so`, `elf`, `apk`, `dex`, `wasm`, and similar files with `r2` / `radare2`
- Asks how to use `rabin2`, `rasm2`, `radiff2`, `rahash2`, `rax2`
- Needs command-line disassembly, function listing, string listing, import/export inspection, cross-reference lookup, or patching
- Needs to write `radare2` batch commands, `-c` automation command strings, or `r2pipe` scripts

If the user explicitly wants GUI reversing, Hex-Rays-style pseudocode, or an IDA workflow, prefer `ida-reverse`. For web JS reversing, prefer `reverse-engineering`.

## Confirm the environment first

Don't assume `r2` is available. Check first:

```powershell
r2 -v
rabin2 -v
```

If not installed, check common install locations or prompt for installation.

Common Windows executables:

- `radare2.exe`
- `rabin2.exe`
- `rasm2.exe`
- `radiff2.exe`
- `rahash2.exe`
- `rax2.exe`
- `r2pm.exe`

## Bundled resources

This skill ships two resources; reuse them first, don't reassemble a duplicate set of commands each time.

### `scripts/recon.ps1`

Standard recon script, good for a first-pass overview. It outputs:

- Basic info
- Sections
- Imports
- Exports
- Strings
- Optional `r2 -A` auto-analysis summary

Invocation:

```powershell
powershell -File "<skill-root>\radare2\scripts\recon.ps1" -TargetPath "C:\path\to\sample.exe"
```

If you also need `r2` auto-analysis:

```powershell
powershell -File "<skill-root>\radare2\scripts\recon.ps1" -TargetPath "C:\path\to\sample.exe" -RunAnalysis
```

### `references/cheatsheet.md`

When you need more command detail, common scenario templates, or want to quickly recall syntax, read this cheat sheet instead of guessing from memory.

## Known phenomena

### Occasional `.sdb` missing warning on Windows

For some PE files, `rabin2` recon may print a warning like:

```text
ERROR: Cannot find ...\share\format\dll\*.sdb
```

If the main output still returns normally, this usually doesn't affect basic recon conclusions — just continue analyzing. Don't declare the analysis failed over this kind of incidental warning.

## Basic principles

### 1. Recon first, dig deep later

Don't jump straight to full auto-analysis. Use lightweight commands first to confirm file type, architecture, entry point, strings, and import table, then decide whether to run `aaa`, `aaaa`, or targeted analysis.

### 2. Prefer the minimal sufficient command

`radare2` has a huge command set; the user usually only needs the shortest path:

- File info: `rabin2 -I`
- Strings: `rabin2 -z`
- Imports/exports: `rabin2 -i` / `rabin2 -E`
- Interactive analysis: `r2 <file>` then run local commands

### 3. Stay cautious before modifying

If the user wants to patch a binary:

- Open read-only by default: `r2 <file>`
- Only use write mode when modification is clearly needed: `r2 -w <file>` or `oo+` in a session
- Warn about the risk before modifying, to avoid unintentionally overwriting the original file

## Common workflows

## Workflow 1: Quick recon

Good for when you've just received a binary.

Prefer running the bundled script directly:

```powershell
powershell -File "<skill-root>\radare2\scripts\recon.ps1" -TargetPath "sample.exe"
```

If you only need the manual minimal commands:

```powershell
rabin2 -I sample.exe
rabin2 -z sample.exe
rabin2 -i sample.exe
rabin2 -E sample.exe
```

Focus on:

- File format, bitness, architecture, platform
- Entry point address
- Suspicious strings: URLs, paths, error messages, registry, command-line args
- Import functions: network, file, crypto, process injection, registry operations

## Workflow 2: Analyze functions interactively

```powershell
r2 sample.exe
```

Common commands once inside:

```text
aaa          # standard auto-analysis
afl          # list functions
iz           # list strings
iS           # list sections
is           # list symbols
s entry0     # jump to entry point
pdf          # disassemble current function
VV           # enter visual mode (if the terminal is suitable)
q            # quit
```

Notes:

- Prefer `aaa` by default; don't start with the heavier `aaaa`
- For very large or slow samples, analyze only near the entry first, then expand manually

## Workflow 3: Locate main / key logic

```text
afl~main
afl~sym.
iz~http
iz~error
axt <addr>
```

Approach:

- Start from `main`, the entry point, and string references
- Use `axt` to find who references a given string or address
- Once you find the reference site, `s <addr>` then `pdf`

## Workflow 4: Hex and memory inspection

```text
px 64        # 64 bytes of hex from current address
pd 20        # disassemble 20 instructions
psz          # read string at current address
pxa          # friendlier hex view
```

## Workflow 5: Binary patching

Only use when the user explicitly asks to modify a file:

```powershell
r2 -w sample.exe
```

Once inside, for example:

```text
s 0x401000
wa nop
wa jmp 0x401050
wq
```

Common write operations:

- `wa <asm>`: write assembly
- `wx <hex>`: write raw bytes
- `wq`: write and quit

Back up the original file first. If the user didn't mention a backup, remind them at least once.

## Workflow 6: Non-interactive automation

Good for a one-shot result:

```powershell
r2 -A -q -c "afl;iz;ii;q" sample.exe
```

Common flags:

- `-A`: auto-analyze at startup
- `-q`: quiet mode
- `-c`: run a command string

If there are many commands, organize them into a readable order; don't cram them into an unmaintainable super-long string.

Better to lay a foundation with the bundled recon script first, then decide whether to add custom commands.

## Common sub-tools

### `rabin2`

Good for static info extraction:

```powershell
rabin2 -I sample.exe   # 基本信息
rabin2 -S sample.exe   # 节区
rabin2 -s sample.exe   # 符号
rabin2 -i sample.exe   # 导入
rabin2 -E sample.exe   # 导出
rabin2 -z sample.exe   # 字符串
rabin2 -zz sample.exe  # 更详细字符串
```

### `rasm2`

Good for quick assembly/disassembly:

```powershell
rasm2 -d "9090"
rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 "xor eax, eax"
```

### `radiff2`

Good for comparing two binaries:

```powershell
radiff2 old.exe new.exe
radiff2 -C old.exe new.exe
```

### `rahash2`

Good for computing hashes:

```powershell
rahash2 -a md5 sample.exe
rahash2 -a sha256 sample.exe
```

### `rax2`

Good for base and encoding conversion:

```powershell
rax2 0x401000
rax2 4198400
rax2 -s hello
```

## Recommended analysis order

For an unknown sample, follow this order:

1. `rabin2 -I` for format, architecture, entry point
2. `rabin2 -z` for strings
3. `rabin2 -i` for import functions
4. If interactive analysis is needed, enter `r2`
5. `aaa` first, then `afl` / `iz` / `pdf`
6. Progressively locate key functions via string references, import calls, and the entry flow

The benefit of this order is low noise and quick orientation.

## Windows notes

- When paths contain spaces, quote them correctly in the command
- If the current terminal can't find `r2`, `PATH` may have just been updated — open a new terminal and retry
- Some samples need admin privileges to read, but don't proactively elevate by default unless the user explicitly needs it
- Before dynamically debugging a suspicious sample, confirm user intent first to avoid mishaps

## Output style

When the user doesn't just want commands but wants you to actually analyze the file:

- Give a recon summary first
- Then list the key evidence: strings, imports, functions, addresses
- Finally give next-step suggestions or continue deeper analysis

Don't just list commands without explaining why.

## Typical request examples

### Example 1: Analyze an exe

User: `帮我看看这个 exe 干了什么，用 radare2 就行`

Handling:

1. Start with `rabin2 -I/-z/-i`
2. Judge whether entering `r2` is needed
3. Dig into the entry and key string references with `aaa`, `afl`, `pdf`

### Example 2: Find where a string is called

User: `这个报错字符串在哪个函数里触发的`

Handling:

1. Find the string address with `iz~keyword`
2. Find references with `axt <addr>`
3. Jump to the reference site with `s <addr>` then `pdf`

### Example 3: Flip a jump

User: `把这个 jne 改成 je`

Handling:

1. Confirm the target address first
2. Clearly state you're entering write mode
3. Use `wa je <target>` or write `wx` directly
4. Disassemble again to verify after modifying

## Practices to avoid

- Don't treat `radare2` as a tool with only the single command `aaa`
- Don't open a user's file in write mode without stating the risk
- Don't draw conclusions before doing basic recon
- Don't misroute web JS reversing to this skill; that's `reverse-engineering`'s scope

- Standard recon script: `scripts/recon.ps1`

## Routing context

**Upstream entry**: `skills/SKILL.md` (master control), `routing.md`
**Upstream alternative**: `ida-reverse/` (escalate to IDA when decompilation/pseudocode is needed)
**Downstream exits**:
- Need dynamic analysis → `reverse-engineering/tools-dynamic.md` (Frida/GDB)
- Need deep decompilation → `ida-reverse/`
- After finding interesting strings via PAT and needing cross-references → `ida-reverse/` (IDA's xref is more powerful)

**Sibling related module**: `ida-reverse/` (complementary: r2 recons fast, IDA decompiles deep)

---

## On-Demand Bootstrap

This skill's entry scripts are wired into the unified bootstrap system. When radare2 is missing it does not error out directly; it automatically attempts installation.

### Automation capability boundaries

| Tool | Auto-installable | Method | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|------|
| r2 | ✓ | GitHub Release ZIP (w64) | Auto download & extract to `%USERPROFILE%\Tools\radare2\` |
| rabin2 | ✓ | same as above (included in the radare2 distribution) | — |
| rasm2 | ✓ | same as above | — |
| radiff2 | ✓ | same as above | — |
| rahash2 | ✓ | same as above | — |
| rax2 | ✓ | same as above | — |

### Bootstrap trigger points

- `scripts/recon.ps1`: auto-calls `bootstrap-reverse.ps1` when `rabin2` or `r2` is missing

### On bootstrap failure

If auto-install fails (no network, GitHub API rate limiting, etc.), the script raises an explicit error with a manual-install link.

Manual install: download `radare2-*-w64.zip` from https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/releases, extract to `%USERPROFILE%\Tools\radare2\`, and ensure the `bin\` directory is on PATH.


## Task-completion self-check (MUST pass before claiming completion)

- [ ] Did I execute every step of the workflow (not just read it)?
- [ ] Did I use real tool paths based on `tool-index`?
- [ ] Did I produce reproducible evidence (commands/scripts/screenshots/report)?
- [ ] Did I complete and write back the Checklist items required by RULES?
