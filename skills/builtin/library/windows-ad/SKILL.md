# Windows / Active Directory Security

## ACTION REQUIRED (execute immediately after reading)

1. `NOW`: read `../field-journal/precedent-pentest.md`
2. `NOW`: **domain/AD testing must have an explicit authorization scope** (including DCs, and whether poisoning/relay is allowed)
3. `NOW`: case-init; write out network_profile and forbidden actions
4. `NEXT`: tool-index (impacket/certipy/bloodhound, etc., often run manually)
5. `ACT`: start from identity enumeration and the BloodHound graph, don't lead with destructive exploitation

## Applicable scenarios

- Domain penetration, Kerberoasting, AS-REP, delegation
- AD CS (ESC1–ESC8, etc.) certificate attacks
- BloodHound / SharpHound attack paths
- NTLM Relay / Coercer forced authentication
- Local privilege escalation to a domain path (Potato, etc. as a stepping stone)

## Relationship with attack-chain

- **Multi-stage from external network to domain controller** → PRIMARY may still be `attack-chain/`, this skill is the **AD specialty**
- **Already inside the domain, focused on identity** → PRIMARY = this skill

## Workflow

### 1. Enumeration

```bash
# Example Impacket / built-in (needs credentials and authorization)
nxc smb <range> -u user -p pass
bloodhound-python -d domain.local -u user -p pass -c All -ns <DC>
```

### 2. Common paths (graph before guns)

```text
□ Kerberoast / AS-REP → offline cracking
□ ACL abuse (GenericAll/WriteDacl)
□ Delegation (unconstrained/constrained/resource-based)
□ AD CS template errors → Certipy
□ Relay: LLMNR/NBT-NS + ntlmrelayx (confirm authorization)
```

### 3. Credentials and lateral movement

```text
□ secretsdump / lsassy / mimikatz (strict authorization and cleanup)
□ PtH / PtT / golden ticket only within authorized red-team scope
□ Write Evidence at each step; get user confirmation for high-risk ones
```

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|
| BloodHound / SharpHound | Path graph |
| Certipy | AD CS |
| Impacket / NetExec | Lateral movement and enumeration |
| Rubeus / Mimikatz | Tickets and credentials (authorized) |
| Coercer / Responder | Forced authentication / poisoning |

## Routing context

**Upstream**: MASTER R24  
**Downstream**: report `docs-generator`; needs EDR research `edr-bypass-re`  
**MUST NOT**: unauthorized DCSync / golden ticket against production

## Task-completion self-check

- [ ] Did I have a graph/enumeration before exploitation?
- [ ] Did I record reproducible commands and sanitize them?
- [ ] Did I obey the scope's forbidden items?
- [ ] Checklist?
