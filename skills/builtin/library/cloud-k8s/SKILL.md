# Cloud / Container / Kubernetes Security

## ACTION REQUIRED (execute immediately after reading)

1. `NOW`: read `../field-journal/precedent-pentest.md` — **cloud/K8s testing requires written authorization**
2. `NOW`: case-init + scope; state account boundaries, forbid destructive operations
3. `NOW`: confirm this is cloud metadata/container/K8s/IAM, not ordinary Web scanning (the latter → `pentest-tools/`)
4. `NEXT`: tool-index; kubectl/aws/gcloud, etc., mostly manual installs
5. `ACT`: start from "identity and exposure surface", no default internet-wide scanning

## Applicable scenarios

- Cloud metadata SSRF (169.254.169.254 / IMDS)
- IAM excessive privileges, public buckets, wrong security groups
- Docker/containerd escape-path assessment
- Kubernetes RBAC, Secrets, Admission, supply-chain images
- Container-image vulnerabilities (can integrate with `supply-chain-security/`)

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — identity and boundaries

```text
□ Current identity: cloud AK/SK, K8s SA, node SSH?
□ Scope: single account / single cluster / single namespace
□ Network profile: authorized_target_only
```

### Phase 2 — cloud control plane

```bash
# Example
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws s3 ls
# Azure / GCP corresponding identity commands
```

```text
□ Public buckets / wrong ACLs
□ Metadata: IMDSv1 vs v2; SSRF chain
□ Assumable roles (PassRole) and lateral movement
```

### Phase 3 — containers

```text
□ Whether privileged / hostPath / hostNetwork
□ capabilities (SYS_ADMIN, etc.)
□ Writable host paths → escape candidates
□ Image history and known CVEs → Trivy
```

### Phase 4 — Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl auth can-i --list
kubectl get pods,secrets,svc -A
kubectl get clusterrolebindings
```

```text
□ SA token mounts and permissions
□ Missing dangerous admission webhooks
□ etcd / dashboard exposure
□ Whether network policy allows by default
```

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose | Bootstrap |
|------|------|------|
| kubectl | Cluster interaction | manual |
| trivy | Image/IaC | bootstrap `trivy` if available |
| kube-bench / kubeaudit | CIS/config | manual |
| pacu / scoutsuite | Cloud audit (authorized) | manual |
| nuclei | Known cloud-vuln templates | bootstrap nmap/nuclei ecosystem |

## Routing context

**Upstream**: MASTER R23  
**Downstream**: got a node shell → `attack-chain` / `windows-ad`; image vulns → supply-chain  
**MUST NOT**: unauthorized scanning of other public-cloud tenants

## Task-completion self-check

- [ ] Is it scoped to the authorized account/cluster?
- [ ] Do findings include reproduction and impact?
- [ ] Did I avoid destructive operations?
- [ ] Report / journal?
