# Deploy Infra / Deployment Infrastructure

> Source: cursor-team-kit review-and-ship + docker/kubernetes deployment patterns

## Trigger routing
Keywords: docker、容器、k8s、kubernetes、部署、deploy、CI/CD、nginx、helm、terraform

## SOP: deployment process

### Phase 1: pre-deploy checks
1. Confirm the target environment: dev / staging / production
2. Check that all env vars/secrets are configured (not hard-coded in the source)
3. Confirm database migration scripts are prepared
4. Confirm a rollback plan exists (previous version's image/package)

### Phase 2: containerization
1. **Dockerfile best practices**:
   - Multi-stage build to reduce image size
   - Run as non-root user
   - HEALTHCHECK instruction
   - `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
2. **docker-compose**: service orchestration, networks, volumes
3. **K8s**: Deployment + Service + Ingress + ConfigMap/Secret

### Phase 3: deployment execution
1. Gray/canary: 10% traffic first → monitor → full rollout
2. Blue-green deploy: switch traffic once the new environment is ready
3. Health checks: HTTP 200 /ready + /healthz
4. Log monitoring: no error spike within 5 minutes of startup

### Phase 4: post-deploy verification
1. Smoke test: key API endpoints HTTP 200
2. Database connection normal
3. Frontend pages accessible
4. Dashboard metrics normal (CPU, memory, latency, error rate)

## Environment-difference matrix

| Config item | Dev | Staging | Production |
|--------|-----|---------|------------|
| Replicas | 1 | 2 | 3+ |
| Log level | DEBUG | INFO | WARN |
| Resource limit | 256Mi | 512Mi | 2Gi |
| Autoscaling | off | on (conservative) | on (standard) |
| Backup | none | daily | hourly + off-site |

## Rollback SOP
1. Trigger condition: error rate >5% for 2 minutes
2. Execute: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/app` or switch the docker image tag
3. Verify: re-run the smoke test after rollback
4. Record: rollback reason + impact scope + fix plan

## Forbidden actions
- Do not skip gray release and go straight to full rollout
- Do not commit secrets to the repository
- Do not ignore health-check failures
