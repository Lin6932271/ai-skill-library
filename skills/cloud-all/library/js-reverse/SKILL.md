# MCP front-end JS reversing operations spec

## ACTION REQUIRED (execute immediately after reading)

2. `NOW`: confirm whether the current task falls within this skill's applicable scope
3. `NEXT`: read `../tool-index.md`, verify tool availability and actual paths
4. `NEXT`: when a tool is missing, invoke bootstrap; do not guess paths
5. `ACT`: enter step 1 of the "Workflow" and execute; do not stop at a confirmation state

## Applicable scope

Prefer this skill when the task belongs to the following scenarios:

- Locate an interface signature, encrypted parameter, or risk-control field
- Observe the page's request chain and script sources
- Capture a function's input args and return values at runtime
- Trace the trigger point of a given XHR/Fetch/WebSocket
- Bring page evidence back to Node for local reproduction and environment patching

If the target is a binary, APK, PE, ELF, DLL, or SO, use `ida-reverse`, `radare2`, or `reverse-engineering` instead.

## Default tool mapping in the current environment

This skill does not assume bare tool names exist; it binds by default to the `js-reverse_*` tools available in the current client environment.

If the current task explicitly mentions `jshookmcp`, `JS hook`, `CDP`, browser breakpoints, network interception, SourceMap, or AST deobfuscation, still go through this skill; just switch the underlying MCP surface to `jshookmcp` rather than treating it as a new master entry.

Prerequisite: `jshookmcp` is not a local bare-command tool but an MCP server that must first be downloaded/registered/enabled. Only after it is wired into the Claude MCP config and enabled do the relevant tool surfaces become callable.

Common mapping:

- `list_scripts` -> `js-reverse_list_scripts`
- `get_script_source` -> `js-reverse_get_script_source`
- `search_in_sources` -> `js-reverse_search_in_sources`
- `break_on_xhr` -> `js-reverse_break_on_xhr`
- `evaluate_script` -> `js-reverse_evaluate_script`
- `get_paused_info` -> `js-reverse_get_paused_info`
- `set_breakpoint_on_text` -> `js-reverse_set_breakpoint_on_text`
- `list_network_requests` -> `js-reverse_list_network_requests`
- `get_request_initiator` -> `js-reverse_get_request_initiator`
- `get_websocket_messages` -> `js-reverse_get_websocket_messages`
- `take_screenshot` -> `js-reverse_take_screenshot`
- `new_page` -> `js-reverse_new_page`
- `navigate_page` -> `js-reverse_navigate_page`
- `select_page` -> `js-reverse_select_page`
- `select_frame` -> `js-reverse_select_frame`
- `pause/resume` -> `js-reverse_pause_or_resume`

If the tool-name prefix changes in the future, update this section first; do not improvise a guess at execution time.

### The positioning of jshookmcp

- Role: an enhanced execution surface for `js-reverse`, not a standalone master control
- Good for: browser automation, CDP debugging, JS Hook, network interception, SourceMap reconstruction, AST-assisted understanding
- Call prerequisite: first download and register `@jshookmcp/jshook` into the MCP client config, then ensure that server is enabled
- Suggested entry: still execute by `Observe → Capture → Rebuild`, only prefer jshookmcp's browser and Hook capabilities during the `Observe/Capture` stages
- Relationship to anything-analyzer: both can do browser/network-side forensics; anything-analyzer leans toward capture and HTTP analysis, jshookmcp leans toward the JS runtime, CDP, Hook, and source understanding

## Core principles

- `Observe-first`
- `Hook-preferred`
- `Breakpoint-last`
- `Rebuild-oriented`
- `Evidence-first`

Observe the page first, then sample minimally, then patch the environment locally; don't skip forensics and guess the environment directly.

## Five-stage workflow

### 1. Observe

Goal: first confirm the target request, related scripts, and candidate functions — don't guess the environment.

Default actions:

- Open the target page with `js-reverse_new_page` or `js-reverse_navigate_page`
- Find the target request with `js-reverse_list_network_requests`
- Trace back the caller with `js-reverse_get_request_initiator`
- Narrow the script scope with `js-reverse_list_scripts`, `js-reverse_search_in_sources`

Must produce:

- Target request URL or characteristics
- initiator lead
- Suspicious script URL
- Initial task record

### 2. Capture

Goal: minimally invasive sampling of the target request to get parameter samples, call order, and runtime evidence.

Rules:

- Prefer `js-reverse_break_on_xhr`
- Prefer `js-reverse_evaluate_script` for lightweight runtime observation
- After a hit, look at `js-reverse_get_paused_info` first
- Use `js-reverse_set_breakpoint_on_text` only when necessary

### 3. Rebuild

Goal: organize the page evidence into locally iterable Node reproduction material.

Rules:

- Local environment patching must be based on observed page evidence
- No fanciful patching of `window/document/navigator/crypto/storage`
- Record only one minimal causal patch decision at a time

### 4. Patch

Goal: drive environment patching by errors and first divergence until the local script stably produces the target parameter.

Rules:

- See what's missing first, then patch it
- Make only one minimal patch decision at a time
- Retest immediately after each patch
- Write every patch into the task record

### 5. DeepDive

Goal: after it runs locally, do deobfuscation, control-flow recovery, and business-logic purification.

Rules:

- If the current task is only to produce the signature, this stage can be downgraded
- If the algorithm chain will be reused long-term, this stage is mandatory

## Execution requirements

- Write all important steps into the local task artifact
- If you can't explain why you're calling a tool, don't call it
- Prefer using the ready-made MCP capabilities of `js-reverse_*` or jshookmcp to gather evidence directly; don't write a script to re-create the capability first
- On failure, fall back per `references/fallbacks.md`
- Output follows `references/output-contract.md`

## Routing context

**Upstream entry**: `skills/SKILL.md` (master control), `routing.md`
**Upstream alternatives**:
- The browser tools of anything-analyzer MCP (port 23816) can serve as an alternative or supplement
- jshookmcp can serve as a stronger browser/CDP/Hook/Network/SourceMap/AST execution surface
- `reverse-engineering/SKILL.md` (if the target is not front-end JS)

**Downstream exit**:
- Need environment patching → `references/env-patching.md`
- Need local reproduction → `references/local-rebuild.md` / `references/node-env-rebuild.md`
- Need deobfuscation → `references/ast-deobfuscation.md`
- Fall back when a path is blocked → `references/fallbacks.md`

**Peer-related module**: anything-analyzer MCP (its browser automation and HTTP capture capabilities are complementary)

## On-Demand Bootstrap

The MCP capabilities this skill depends on can be auto-registered via the unified bootstrap system.

### Automation capability boundary

| Capability | Auto-registrable | Method | Note |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| jshookmcp | ✓ | npm-mcp (npx launch) | Auto-writes into the Claude MCP config |
| anything-analyzer | ✓ | local-http-mcp | Auto-register + can auto-start the service |
| Node.js | ✓ | winget install | Runtime dependency |

### Bootstrap method

```powershell
# 注册 jshookmcp 到 MCP 配置
powershell -File "<skill-root>\scripts\bootstrap-reverse.ps1" -Capability @('jshookmcp')

# 注册并启动 anything-analyzer
powershell -File "<skill-root>\scripts\bootstrap-reverse.ps1" -Capability @('anything-analyzer') -StartServices
```

### Notes

- After `jshookmcp` is registered, you still need to **enable** that MCP server in the AI client before it can be called
- `anything-analyzer` needs pnpm and the project source; bootstrap will auto-clone and install dependencies
- If Node.js is not installed, bootstrap will first install Node.js 22 via winget

<br><br>## Task-completion self-check (MUST pass before claiming completion)

- [ ] Did I execute every step in the workflow (not just read it)?
- [ ] Did I use real tool paths based on `tool-index`?
- [ ] Did I produce reproducible evidence (commands/scripts/screenshots/report)?
- [ ] Did I complete and write back the Checklist items required by RULES?
